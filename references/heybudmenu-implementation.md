## Technical Implementation Details

### Architecture Overview
The DK Mega Menu is implemented as a header menu style rather than a standalone section. This provides:
- **Seamless Integration**: Works within the existing header menu system
- **Proper Positioning**: Dropdown positioning handled by header menu component
- **Animation Support**: Uses existing header menu animation system
- **Mobile Compatibility**: Integrates with existing mobile menu drawer

### CSS Architecture
The mega menu uses a responsive grid layout:
```css
.dk-mega-menu {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: auto 1fr 1fr 2fr; /* Navigation | Skincare | Haircare | Featured Products */
  gap: var(--gap-desktop);
}

@media (max-width: 750px) {
  .dk-mega-menu {
    grid-template-columns: 1fr;
    gap: var(--gap-mobile);
  }
}
```

### Integration Points
- **Header Menu System**: Extends `blocks/_header-menu.liquid` with new menu style option
- **Existing Animations**: Uses `--submenu-animation-speed` for consistent behavior
- **Theme Patterns**: Follows Boond 2025 gap control system and layout patterns
- **Mobile Integration**: Works with existing `header-drawer` mobile menu system

## Setup Requirements

### Required Shopify Menus
To use the DK Mega Menu, you'll need to create these menus in your Shopify admin:

1. **Skincare Menu**
   - Create a new menu with links like: "Dry + Sensitive", "Hyperpigmentation", "Acne", etc.
   - Each link should point to relevant collection or product pages

2. **Haircare Menu**  
   - Create a new menu with links like: "Hair Essentials Bundle", "Hair Mask", "Hair Growth Serum", etc.
   - Each link should point to relevant collection or product pages

### Required Collections

- Ensure products have proper data (images, descriptions, pricing) for best display

### Navigation Categories Setup
The left sidebar categories are configured via the theme settings:
- Default: "Best Sellers,Build Your Own Bundle,Subscribe & Save"

## Boond 2025 Theme Specific Considerations

- **Custom Properties:** Use existing CSS variable patterns

### Theme Patterns to Follow
- **Block Architecture:** All components should be blocks within sections
- **Shopify Attributes:** Use `{{ block.shopify_attributes }}` for editor integration
- **Animation System:** Follow existing `--submenu-animation-speed` patterns
- **Mobile Drawer:** Integrate with existing `header-drawer` system
- **Transparent Header:** Maintain compatibility with transparent header modes

### Existing Components to Extend
- `blocks/_header-menu.liquid` - Main menu system
- `snippets/slideshow.liquid` - For featured products carousel
- `snippets/layout-panel-style.liquid` - For responsive gap controls
- `assets/header-menu.js` - For menu interactions

## Notes

This implementation leverages the **Boond 2025** theme architecture specifically, ensuring compatibility with the existing gap control system, header menu functionality, and responsive design patterns. The modular block-based approach maintains consistency with the theme's existing components while providing the flexibility needed for the Hey Bud menu design.
